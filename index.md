# Ethan Belmont
Welcome to my professional and academic portfolio! I am a Physicist, with a minor in Astrophysics, graduating from the University of Connecticut in May of 2027. I have a current GPA of 3.149, I am working hard to hone my proficiency in relativity, quantum and particle physics, and the mechanisms of spectroscopy. I am also working to improve my skills in physical computation software.

### About Me
I gained critical knowledge of computational systems through classes such as Advanced Undergrad Laboratory, Math Methods for the Physical Sciences, and Computational Physics, at the University of Connecticut. These programs were used to solve complex physical problems using coding language. My expertise in this field includes:
- __Jekyll__: Building this very website
- __Python__: Creating lab reports
- __Jupyter__: Interfacing with Github Notebooks
- __Wolfram__: Coding and computing advanced physics calculations

### Academic Experience
I have already listed some practical skills I've gained from my classes; here are the real-life applications that I have used these skills for.
